# Zettel

This is a simple CRUD(Create-Read-Update-Delete) Application.<br>
The user can add the note with title and content and then delete it when they don't need it anymore.<br>
I learned basic react hooks, props, and material-ui through this practice.<br>
This is built based on Udemy Course. I just changed the application name and added a little bit of personal touch on CSS.
